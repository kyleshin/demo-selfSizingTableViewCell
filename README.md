## Sample Code For Self Sizing Table View Cell
## Also Implements Dynamic Font Size.

Demonstrate how to implement self/auto sizing table view cells. In this sample,
cells include image view, label, text view, and button embedded inside a stack view.
Label and text view uses dynamic font size.

In order to see the sizes of label and text view, I gave them different and bright
background colors. So they would stand out.

My [blog post](https://www.kyleshin.info/blog/2019/01/02/self-sizing-tableView-cells) explains the code in detail.
